Exercises solved on the book "The Python Workbook" - A Brief Introduction with Exercises and Solutions


This book can be used in a variety of ways. It can supplement another textbook
that has a limited selection of exercises, or it can be used as the sole source of
exercises when an instructor has decided not to use another textbook. A motivated
individual could also learn Python programming by carefully studying each of the
included exercises and solutions, though there are probably easier ways to learn the
language. No matter what other resources you use with this book, completing the
exercises and studying the provided solutions will enhance your programming
ability.

Also, my solves to the exercises are different from the ones from this book.
