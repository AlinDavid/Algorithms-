Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived approximately 2,300 years ago. His
algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers, a and
b, is both efficient and recursive.

Write a program that implements Euclidâ€™s algorithm and uses it to determine the
greatest common divisor of two integers entered by the user.
